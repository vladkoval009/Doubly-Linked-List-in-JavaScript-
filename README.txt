I have created and implemented a doubly linked list class in JavaScript

File structure:

Using our Node class to hold the data and links between nodes

Implementing a DoublyLinkedList class to handle external operations on the list, like adding and removing nodes

Creating an instance of our list, and using the .printList() method to track the changes we made
